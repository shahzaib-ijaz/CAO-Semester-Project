# CAO-Semester-Project

My project is an anti-Intruder alarm system.

I have used a motion detector to detect any motion and when it does, the LED lights turn on.

This will helpful to alarm in case of any intrusion.

I have used the following hardware for the project:

1, ESP-32
2, LED Lights
3, Motion Detector
