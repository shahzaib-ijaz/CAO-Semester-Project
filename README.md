# CAO-Semester-Project

My project is an anti-Intruder alarm system. Application of the project can be anti-theft system, etc


I have used a motion detector to detect any motion and when it does, the LED lights turn on.


This will helpful to alarm in case of any intrusion.


I have used the following hardware for the project:


1) ESP-32
2) LED Lights
3) Motion Detector i.e
   PIR Motion sensor
